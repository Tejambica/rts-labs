I personally like Java as a dynamic and international language, but I feel a lot could be made much easier. 
The GUI is one thing I feel is not very attracting. Java, I feel is much difficult to read than many other languages. 
Another thing I worry about while using Java is it occupies more space. Many times I compare Java with Python. Things can be done very easily and quickly in Python than in Java. 
The HTTP connectings, cookies management, even the I/O functionality requires lot of coding compared to others. 
Thus by changing the UI interface and implementing easier code to perform functionalities, it would become the best language ever.
