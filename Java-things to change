I personally like Java as a dynamic and international language, but I feel a lot could be made much easier. 
Java, I feel is much difficult to read than many other languages and occupies more space when compred to Python. 
Things like HTTP connections, cookies management, even the I/O functionality can be done very easily and quickly in Python than in Java which requires lot of coding.
Coding and setting up functionalities in java is much complicated so changing the implemention to perform a particular functionality would make java even simpler to use.
Also the conversion to bytecode would make performance an issue in some cases.
